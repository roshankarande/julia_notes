## Type stable / instable functions

https://blog.sintef.com/industry-en/writing-type-stable-julia-code/

```julia
f(i) = i%2 == 0 ? i/2 : 2*i

# @code_warntype f(1)
# MethodInstance for f(::Int64)
#   from f(i) in Main at REPL[73]:1
# Arguments
#   #self#::Core.Const(f)
#   i::Int64
# Body::Union{Float64, Int64}
# 1 ─ %1 = (i % 2)::Int64
# │   %2 = (%1 == 0)::Bool
# └──      goto #3 if not %2
# 2 ─ %4 = (i / 2)::Float64
# └──      return %4
# 3 ─ %6 = (2 * i)::Int64
# └──      return %6

# ---- Instable for Ints, stable for float

# @code_warntype f(1.1)
# MethodInstance for f(::Float64)
#   from f(i) in Main at REPL[73]:1
# Arguments
#   #self#::Core.Const(f)
#   i::Float64
# Body::Float64
# 1 ─ %1 = (i % 2)::Float64
# │   %2 = (%1 == 0)::Bool
# └──      goto #3 if not %2
# 2 ─ %4 = (i / 2)::Float64
# └──      return %4
# 3 ─ %6 = (2 * i)::Float64
# └──      return %6


```


If the source code of the method is well written, the source code and the concrete type of all arguments is enough information for the compiler to infer the concrete type of every variable and expression within the method. The method is then said to be “typestable”, and the Julia compiler will produce efficient code.

If, for a variety of reasons that will be studied in the following, the type of a local variable cannot be inferred from the types of the arguments, the compiler will produce machine code full of “if”s, covering all options of what the type of each variable could be. The loss in performance is often significant, easily by a factor of 10.
