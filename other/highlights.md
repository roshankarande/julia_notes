# Highlights of Julia

feels like Python ... runs like C

1. Multiple Dispatch
2. Type Inference and Type Specializations
3. Well defined abstrations
4. Integrations with other Languages - Python, C++, R, Fortran ,C
5. Interfaces with LLVM
6. Type System ... careful balance between static and dynamic
7. JIT compilation
8. MetaProgramming
9. Compiles to GPU at multiple levels and not juts lowest CUDA level 

10. Let's you focus on the what of the problem and not how to certain stuff( makes how to do stuff very easy... )
