## How to add a package

Julia provides a large package library. To add a package, we enter the package REPL by pressing ] and install a package by the keyword add.

```julia
# Press ] from REPL to enter and Cntrl + C to exit.
? # to get help
add Plots  # by default adds the latest stable version
# using Pkg ; Pkg.add("Plots") # another way
add BSON@0.2.1 # to add a specific verision of package

status # or st to see the status of all installed packages

upate BSON # to update the package
pin BSON@0.2.1 # so that updating it is not possible
free BSON # to unpin the package BSON
remove BSON # or rm to remove the package
```

## Environments

Julia package manager offers significant advantages over traditional package managers by organizing dependencies into environments. Julia handles environments natively within Julia itself.

```julia
julia> mkdir("./tutorial") # create a folder named tutorial
julia> cd("./tutorial") # change the working directory to tutorial
(@v1.7) pkg> activate . # alternatively we can specify full path
#  Activating new environment at `path/to/the/tutorial/Project.toml`
(tutorial) pkg> status # see the location .toml file is changed
add BSON JSON
# Since we added two new packages, this information is stored in the files Project.toml and Manifest.toml.

```
The Project.toml file describes the project on a high level. It contains the package/project dependencies and compatibility constraints. On the other hand, the Manifest.toml file is an absolute record of the state of packages used in the environment. It includes exact information about (direct and indirect) dependencies of the project. Given Project.toml and Manifest.toml, it is possible to instantiate the same package environment.

```julia
(tutorial) pkg> instantiate
```
