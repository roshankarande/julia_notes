## How to add a package

Julia provides a large package library. To add a package, we enter the package REPL by pressing ] and install a package by the keyword add.

```julia
# Press ] from REPL to enter and Cntrl + C to exit.
? # to get help

add Plots  # by default adds the latest stable version
# using Pkg ; Pkg.add("Plots") # another way
add BSON@0.2.1 # to add a specific verision of package
# add ../ImageInspector # to add a relative package

status # or st to see the status of all installed packages

upate BSON # to update the package
pin BSON@0.2.1 # so that updating it is not possible
free BSON # to unpin the package BSON
remove BSON # or rm to remove the package

dev /absolute/or/relative/path/ImageInspector/ # to Then we use the dev (or develop) command to tell Julia that the ImageInspector folder is a package, and we want to start its development.

test ImageInspector  # to test our developed package ImageInspector
```

## Environments

Julia package manager offers significant advantages over traditional package managers by organizing dependencies into environments. Julia handles environments natively within Julia itself.

```julia
julia> mkdir("./tutorial") # create a folder named tutorial
julia> cd("./tutorial") # change the working directory to tutorial
(@v1.7) pkg> activate . # alternatively we can specify full path
#  Activating new environment at `path/to/the/tutorial/Project.toml`
(tutorial) pkg> status # see the location .toml file is changed
add BSON JSON
# Since we added two new packages, this information is stored in the files Project.toml and Manifest.toml.

```
The Project.toml file describes the project on a high level. It contains the package/project dependencies and compatibility constraints. On the other hand, the Manifest.toml file is an absolute record of the state of packages used in the environment. It includes exact information about (direct and indirect) dependencies of the project. Given Project.toml and Manifest.toml, it is possible to instantiate the same package environment.

```julia
(tutorial) pkg> instantiate
```

## Package Development

```julia
using PkgTemplates

template = Template(;
    user = "roshankarande",   
    authors = ["Roshan Karande"],   
    dir = "C:/Users/heyia/Desktop/junk/juli_pkg", # dir where pkg created
    julia = VersionNumber("$VERSION"),                     # compat version of Julia
    plugins = [
        !CompatHelper,                  # disable CompatHelper
        !TagBot,                        # disable TagBot
        Readme(; inline_badges = true), # added readme file with badges
        Tests(; project = true),        # unit tests
        Git(; manifest = false),        # add manifest.toml to .gitignore
        License(; name = "MIT")         # addedIT licence
    ],
)

template("PackageName")

# too add scripts folder 
mkdir(joinpath("/Path/To/Dir/", "ImageInspector", "scripts"))
activate ./scripts  # from (ImageInspector) pkg> 

pwd() # ImageInspector
dev . # or dev C:/Users/heyia/Desktop/junk/juli_pkg/ImageInspector

# Then we use the dev (or develop) command to tell Julia that the ImageInspector folder is a package, and we want to start its development. The important thing to realize is that the working directory is .../ImageInspector, while the working environment is .../ImageInspector/scripts. Since the dot in dev . specifies the working directory, this command will add the package from the working directory into the working environment.
```

```julia
# /src/ImageInspector.jl
module ImageInspector

export greet
greet() = print("Hello World!")
add(a::Real,b::Real) = a + b
end


# /scripts/example.jl
using Revise # this must come before `using ImageInspector`
using ImageInspector
greet()

# Revise is used as we want to enable hot reloading without the need to terminate and create new session. We can add new | modify stuff in ImageInspector and it will be reflected in example.jl

```

NOTE!!
The dependencies of scripts and that of main package are different. So manage that using Pkg manager
```julia
pwd() #  ImageInspector is current directory
activate . # to activate the environment of ImageInspector
# then add necessary dependencies etc
activate ./scripts # to activate the environment of ./scripts
```

## Tests
```julia
# /test/runtests.jl
using ImageInspector
using ImageInspector.Colors
using Test

@testset "ImageInspector.jl" begin
    x1 = [1, 2]
    x2 = [3, 1]

    @testset "$x" for x in [x1, x2]
        @test add(x[1],x[2]) == 3
    end

    @testset "greet" for x in [x1, x2]
        @test greet() == "Hello World!"
    end

    @test_throws MethodError add("Hello","World") # should throw MethodError if done on strings per our function definition
end
```
